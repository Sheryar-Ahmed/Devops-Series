# ðŸš€ DevOps Training - Session 2  
### **Domain Management, Linux Essentials & Advanced Git**  

Welcome to the second session of our DevOps training! In this session, we covered the essentials of domain management, DNS flow, Linux commands, and advanced Git techniques. This README serves as a reference for everything we learned.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ **Session Overview**  
### ðŸ”¹ **1. Understanding Domains & DNS**  
Before diving into domain management, we covered:  
- **Domain Basics:** What is a domain, how it works, and its role in networking.  
- **Types of Domains:**
  - **Top-Level Domains (TLDs)** (e.g., .com, .org, .net, .io)
  - **Second-Level Domains (SLDs)**  
  - **Subdomains**
- **DNS Flow:** How a domain name is resolved to an IP address (recursive & authoritative name servers).

### ðŸ”¹ **2. Configuring DNS for an EC2 Instance with Nginx**  
#### **ðŸ”¸ Direct DNS Configuration (Without AWS Route 53)**  
1. **Purchase a domain** from any provider (e.g., Namecheap, GoDaddy).  
2. **Update the A record** in the domain providerâ€™s DNS settings:
   - Record Type: `A`
   - Value: Public IP of your EC2 instance  
3. **Install Nginx on your EC2 instance**:  
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install nginx -y
   ```
4. **Configure Nginx to serve the domain:**  
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
   ```
   Update the server block:  
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name yourdomain.com;
       root /var/www/html;
       index index.html;
   }
   ```
5. **Restart Nginx**:  
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

#### **ðŸ”¸ Configuring DNS with AWS Route 53**  
1. **Create a Hosted Zone** in AWS Route 53 for your domain.  
2. **Update Name Servers (NS)** in your domain providerâ€™s settings with the ones from Route 53.  
3. **Add an A record** in Route 53 for your EC2 instance:
   - Record Type: `A`
   - Value: Public IP of your EC2 instance

### ðŸ”¹ **3. Advanced Route 53 Routing Policies**  
- **Simple Routing Policy** - Basic DNS resolution.  
- **Latency-Based Routing** - Routes users to the closest low-latency server.  
- **Geolocation-Based Routing** - Directs users based on their region.  
- **Failover Routing** - Ensures high availability by switching traffic to a backup resource.  
- **Weighted Routing** - Distributes traffic across multiple resources based on percentage weights.
